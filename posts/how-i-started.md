First of all, this post is based on my own life experiences and opinions about how I turned myself into a developer

Before becoming a developer, I did sort of things like a sommelier, typist (I was terrible on it, but this year I began to practice more on how to type right and faster, I will probably post something about my process on it...), electronic music producer, DJ, t-shirt brand owner, and the list goes on.

After jumping from job to job, I had my mind blown by the possibility to create apps when I started playing with Android custom ROMs, so I got Java/Android development courses, and god... that was a pain to learn. Years and jobs latter I decided to enroll presential a front-end course, and boom that`s what I wanted to do from that time on.

So I will point out what I did that quickly made me an employed front-end developer.

- I studied as many hours as I could, sometimes 8/10 hours a day focusing on basics first (HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT).

- I told my friends I needed a pause to study, so no parties from now on (having DJ`s friends made it a hard thing to do ... ).

- Learned CSS pre-processors and how to make use of its features.

- I didn`t compare myself with other developers, because everyone has its own learning curve. At first, it`s important to know the basics and practice.

- Being a great googler was the main point to find sources and paths to solve code problems I got stuck.

- Read as many articles from the community as I could, and followed great developers on twitter, I learned a lot from it, also if I didn`t understand some points at first, my brain would make use of it later, so I READ A LOT!

- Follow tutorials on Youtube, but always give myself a break to understand what the code I wrote was about.

- Enrolled and finished at least 5 courses on Udemy and freeCodeCamp.
  I just used frameworks after I got a solid understanding of Javascript.

The path was hard and fun at the same time, but in the end, this is how I got my first job as a front-end developer and learned a lot with my teammates since my first job experience. There is a lot of information and things to mention about the whole experience during my preparation, but I think those were the most important ones in my opinion.

Focus on your dreams and keep studying.
